# urwasm
WebAssembly interpreter suite for Urbit

Continuation of my work on [UWasm](https://github.com/Quodss/wasm-hackathon). Copy the files from `desk` directory to a new Urbit desk and commit them. Run tests with:
```
-test /=wasm=/tests ~
```
or try running your own Wasm modules. This thing is still WIP: it's very slow and not complete. Jetting is in the plans.
